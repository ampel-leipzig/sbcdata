Title:
    Laboratory Diagnostics from Septic and Non-septic Patients Used
    in the AMPEL Project
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2021-11-16
Description:
    The data were collected as part of the AMPEL project
    (Analysis and Reporting System for the Improvement of Patient Safety
    through Real-Time Integration of Laboratory Findings,
    \url{https://ampel.care}).
    They include administration data, sepsis labels based on ICD10 codes
    and laboratory diagnostics from patients admitted to the
    University Hospital Leipzig between Januar 2014 and December 2019 and to the
    University Hospital Greifswald between Januar 2015 and December 2020,
    respectively. Additionally it provides functions to generate a similar
    dataset from MIMIC-IV (Johnson et al. 2021 \doi{10.13026/S6N6-XD98}).
